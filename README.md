# SchedVizRust

SchedVizRust is a native Rust desktop application for simulating and visualizing CPU short-term scheduling algorithms. It supports uniprocessor and multicore scheduling, renders Gantt-style timelines, reports turnaround metrics, and exports results as CSV or 300-DPI PNG images.

## Features

- Uniprocessor scheduling with FCFS, Round Robin, SPN, SRT, and HRRN.
- Multicore scheduling with 2 or 4 cores using FCFS, Round Robin, or SRT.
- Optional multicore on-idle migration to demonstrate load balancing effects.
- Editable process table with built-in examples.
- Synchronized timeline and metrics table scrolling.
- CSV export for per-process metrics.
- PNG export for high-resolution timeline charts.

## Sample Configurations

Multicore configuration:

## Requirements

- Rust 1.85.0 or newer. This is the minimum Rust version required for the Rust 2024 edition used by this crate.
- Cargo
- A desktop environment with graphical application support.

schedviz_rust is intended to be cross-platform. It has been tested on Windows and WSL Ubuntu, and should also work on other Linux desktop environments supported by Rust and the GUI/file-dialog libraries used by the project. The app uses `eframe`/`egui` for the GUI, `rfd` for native file dialogs, and portable Rust crates for CSV and image export. On WSL, GUI support such as WSLg or an X server is required.

## Compile

Compile the release binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled executable is written to:

```bash
# Windows
target\release\schedviz_rust.exe

# Linux / WSL Ubuntu
target/release/schedviz_rust
```

Run tests:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

If the project is stored in a cloud-synced folder, use a local target directory to avoid intermittent build-cache issues:

```bash
# Linux / WSL Ubuntu
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/path/to/local/target cargo run --release
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:CARGO_TARGET_DIR="C:\path\to\local\target"; cargo run --release
```

## Run

Run directly from Cargo:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Or run the compiled executable after `cargo build --release`:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
.\target\release\schedviz_rust.exe
```

```bash
# Linux / WSL Ubuntu
./target/release/schedviz_rust
```

## Using The App

1. Edit the process table or load one of the built-in examples.
2. Choose Uniprocessor or Multicore mode.
3. Select the scheduling algorithm or algorithms.
4. Adjust the Round Robin quantum when RR is selected.
5. Click Calculate to update the timeline and metrics.
6. Export CSV or PNG output when needed.

## Scheduling Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FCFS | Non-preemptive | First-Come, First-Served. |
| RR | Preemptive | Round Robin with quantum 1 through 6. |
| SPN | Non-preemptive | Shortest Process Next. |
| SRT | Preemptive | Shortest Remaining Time. |
| HRRN | Non-preemptive | Highest Response Ratio Next. |

Multicore mode supports FCFS, RR, and SRT. SPN and HRRN are available in uniprocessor mode only.
